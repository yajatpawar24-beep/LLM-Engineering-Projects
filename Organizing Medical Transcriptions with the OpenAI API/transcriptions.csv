Allergy / Immunology,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies.  She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.,MEDICATIONS: , Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.,HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,ASSESSMENT:,  Allergic rhinitis.,PLAN:,1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.,2.  Samples of Nasonex two sprays in each nostril given for three weeks.  A prescription was written as well."
Orthopedic,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Achilles ruptured tendon.,HISTORY:,  Mr. XYZ is 41 years of age, who works for Chevron and lives in Angola.  He was playing basketball in Angola back last Wednesday, Month DD, YYYY, when he was driving toward the basket and felt a pop in his posterior leg.  He was seen locally and diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture.  He has been on crutches and has been nonweightbearing since that time.  He had no pain prior to his injury.  He has had some swelling that is mild.  He has just been on aspirin a day due to his traveling time.  Pain currently is minimal.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Denies diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Malarone, which is an anti-malarial.,ALLERGIES:,  NKDA,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is a petroleum engineer for Chevron.  Drinks socially.  Does not use tobacco.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,  Pleasant gentleman in no acute distress.  He has some mild swelling on the right ankle and hindfoot.  He has motion that is increased into dorsiflexion.  He has good plantarflexion.  Good subtalar, Chopart and forefoot motion.  His motor function is intact although weak into plantarflexion.  Sensation is intact.  Pulses are strong.  In the prone position, he has diminished tension on the affected side.  There is some bruising around the posterior heel.  He has a palpable defect about 6-8 cm proximal to the insertion site that is tender for him.  Squeezing the calf causes no plantarflexion of the foot.,RADIOGRAPHS:,  Of his right ankle today show a preserved joint space.  I don't see any evidence of fracture noted.  Radiographs of the heel show no fracture noted with good alignment.,IMPRESSION:,  Right Achilles tendon rupture.,PLAN:,  I have gone over with Mr. XYZ the options available.  We have discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives to operative versus nonoperative treatment.  Based on his age and his activity level, I think his best option is for operative fixation.  We went over the risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, rerupture of the tendon, weakness and the need for future surgery.  We have discussed doing this as an outpatient procedure.  He would be nonweightbearing in a splint for 10 days, nonweightbearing in a dynamic brace for 4 weeks, and then a walking boot for another six weeks with a lift until three months postop when we can get him into a shoe with a ��"" lift.  He understands a 6-9 month return to sports overall.  He will also need to be on some Lovenox for a week after surgery and then on an aspirin as he is going to travel back to Angola.  Today we will put him in a high tide boot that he will need at six weeks, and we will put him in a 1"" lift also.  He can weight bear until surgery and we will have it set up this week.  His questions were all answered today."
Bariatrics,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Morbid obesity.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Morbid obesity.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic antecolic antegastric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with EEA anastomosis.,ANESTHESIA: , General with endotracheal intubation.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , This is a 30-year-old female, who has been overweight for many years.  She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea.,OPERATION PERFORMED,Neck exploration; tracheostomy; urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY,The patient is a 50-year-old white male with history of progressive tracheomalacia treated in the National Tennessee, and several years ago he had a tracheal metallic stent placed with some temporary improvement.  However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication."
Urology,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Urinary retention.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 66-year-old gentleman status post deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07, who has had recurrent urinary retention issues since that time.  Most recently, he was hospitalized on 02/04/08 for acute renal insufficiency, which was probably secondary to dehydration.  He was seen by urology again at this visit for urinary retention.  He had been seen by urology during a previous hospitalization and he passed his voiding trial at the time of his stent removal on 01/22/08.  Cystoscopy showed at that time obstructive BPH.  He was started on Flomax at the time of discharge from the hospital.  During the most recent readmission on 02/04/08, he went back into urinary retention and he had had a Foley placed at the outside hospital.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Positive for blurred vision, nasal congestion, and occasional constipation.  Denies chest pain, shortness of breath or any rashes or lesions.  All other systems were reviewed and found to be negative.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  End-stage renal disease, now status post deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  History of nephrolithiasis.,4.  Gout.,5.  BPH.,6.  DJD.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,1.  Deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07.,2.

Nystatin swish and swallow.,18.  Dapsone.,19.  Finasteride.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished male, in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, blood pressure 129/72, pulse 96, and weight 175.4 pounds.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Right lower quadrant incision site scar well healed.  Nontender to palpation.  Liver and spleen not enlarged.  No hernias appreciated.  PENIS:  Normal male genitalia.  No lesions appreciated on the penis.  Previous DRE showed the prostate of approximately 40 grams and no nodules.  Foley in place and draining clear urine.,The patient underwent fill and pull study, in which his bladder tolerated 120 ml of sterile water passively filling his bladder.  He spontaneously voided without the Foley 110 mL.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,This is a 66-year-old male with signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, who has had recurrent urinary retention since the kidney transplant in 12/07.  He passed his fill and pull study and was thought to self-catheterize in the event that he does incur urinary retention again.  We discussed with Mr. Barker that he has a urologist closer to his home and he lives approximately 3 hours away; however, he desires to continue follow up with the urology clinic at MCG and has been set up for followup in 6 weeks.  He was also given a prescription for 6 months of Flomax and Proscar.  He did not have a PSA drawn today as he had a catheter in place, therefore his PSA could be falsely elevated.  He will have PSA level drawn either just before his visit for followup."
